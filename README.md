# Claude Code Mastery

A personal dashboard that scores your day-to-day Claude Code usage against
[Boris Cherny's 87 workflow tips](https://howborisusesclaudecode.com) and a
mastery rubric. Reads signals directly from `~/.claude/` — no telemetry, no
external service, nothing leaves your machine unless you enable the Slack
notifier.

- **Two axes, not one composite**: **Platform Setup** (how `~/.claude/` is
  configured) and **Execution** (whether you actually use it, derived from
  `~/.claude/usage-data/`). The diagnostic case is a high Δ — every tool
  installed, none of them fired.
- **12 dimensions**: automation, permissions, model/effort tuning, parallelism,
  verification, memory, planning, integrations, customization, scheduled work,
  remote/mobile, and learning. Each scored independently on each axis where
  data exists; the radar marks honestly-unmeasured Execution dims with italic
  labels and a footnote so they're not silently zero.
- **Deterministic scoring**: signals → rules → number, normalized per-dimension
  to a 100-point scale (`raw / target × 100`). Trend arrows (↗/↘/→) reflect
  real config changes, not vibes.
- **Trend history**: each run appends to `app/data/assessment-history.json`
  (gitignored). After two runs you get meaningful directionality.
- **Optional Slack ping** at 07:15 daily via macOS `launchd`. The dashboard
  stays local; the Slack message is the delivery vehicle.

Claude Code Mastery — Engineer
Platform Setup  78 / 100
Execution       63 / 100 (observed practice)

   46 / 100  →  Automation — Hooks, Commands, Agents (raw 41/90)
   65 / 100  →  Permissions & Safety (raw 55/85) · ex  24
   78 / 100  →  Model & Effort Tuning (raw 70/90)
   …
```

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> claude-mastery
cd claude-mastery
npm install
npm run setup          # creates assessment.config.json and .env.local from examples
npm run assess:print   # score your setup, print to terminal
npm run dev            # open http://localhost:3737
```

That's the whole loop. Everything else is optional polish.

## How scoring works

1. **`scripts/signals.mjs`** reads your local Claude Code state for the
   _Platform Setup_ axis: `~/.claude/settings.json` (effort level, hooks,
   permissions, enabled plugins), the contents of `~/.claude/agents`,
   `~/.claude/commands`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/plans`, and MEMORY.md
   files under `~/.claude/projects/*/memory`.
2. **`scripts/insights-signals.mjs`** + **`scripts/_usage-data.mjs`** read the
   _Execution_ axis from `~/.claude/usage-data/{facets,session-meta}/*.json`
   (the same cooked telemetry `/insights` reads). Optionally scans transcripts
   under `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` for the `★ Insight` banner (learning
   mode), worktree usage, and skill attribution.
3. **`scripts/score.mjs`** applies deterministic rules per dimension and
   normalizes each to 100 (`raw / target × 100`). Nine of twelve dims have
   Execution scorers; the remaining three are routed to _unmeasured_ via
   `gapReason` rather than scored zero. Every number is traceable to a signal.
4. **`scripts/run-assessment.mjs`** orchestrates: signals → score → write
   `app/data/assessment.json`, append `app/data/assessment-history.json`, post
   to Slack if configured.
5. The Next.js app reads `app/data/rubric.json` (static metadata) + the
   generated `assessment.json` and renders the dashboard. See
   [`/methodology`](http://localhost:3737/methodology) for the formula
   breakdown of every scorer.

To retune targets or add a dimension, edit `app/data/rubric.json` and add a
matching scorer in `scripts/score.mjs`. Frontend picks it up automatically.

## Slash commands

Two slash commands ship in `.claude/commands/`:

- **`/self-assessment`** — calls `npm run assess` and reports back the
  Platform Setup + Execution scores, trend deltas, and the top three
  weight×deficit priority actions. Accepts the same flags as the script
  (`--include-transcripts`, `--insights-lookback N`, `--no-slack`, etc).
  Treat it like a morning standup with your toolchain. Full guide:
  [`docs/self-assessment.md`](docs/self-assessment.md).
- **`/refresh-insights`** — files the markdown summary from a `/insights`
  run in the current session into `app/data/insights-narrative.md`. Thin
  convenience wrapper around `pbpaste | npm run import-insights`; never
  invokes `/insights` itself, never paraphrases.

### Running the full workflow

The two slash commands chain with Claude Code's built-in `/insights`. Run
`/insights` first (it's token-heavy and user-initiated), then chain the
filer + scorer in one shot:

```text
/insights

/refresh-insights && /self-assessment \
  --claude-md-target <name>=<absolute-path-to-project-root> \
  --include-transcripts \
  --insights-lookback 30
```

What each piece does:

| Step                | Effect                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/insights`         | Anthropic's built-in command — writes the HTML report and prints the markdown narrative into the session. **Not invoked by this dashboard**; you run it yourself. |
| `/refresh-insights` | Files that markdown verbatim into `app/data/insights-narrative.md` (gitignored).                                                                                  |
| `/self-assessment`  | Calls `npm run assess`, scores Platform Setup + Execution, posts to Slack if configured.                                                                          |

Flag reference for `/self-assessment`:

| Flag                                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--claude-md-target <name=path>` or `<path>` | Audit a CLAUDE.md file at `<path>`. With `name=path`, the report labels it `<name>`; with a bare path, the name defaults to the last directory segment. Repeat the flag for multiple targets. Path can use `~`. |
| `--include-transcripts`                      | Scan the last N days of `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` transcripts for behavioral signals (skill invocation, plan-mode usage, ★ Insight banners, worktree usage).                                               |
| `--no-transcripts`                           | Skip the transcript scan even when `scoring.includeTranscripts: true` in config. Wins over `--include-transcripts`.                                                                                             |
| `--insights-lookback <N>`                    | How many days back to read from `~/.claude/usage-data/`. Defaults to 30 (or `scoring.insightsLookbackDays` in config).                                                                                          |
| `--no-slack`                                 | Skip the Slack post even when `slack.enabled: true`. Useful for ad-hoc local runs.                                                                                                                              |
| `--print`                                    | Print the full block of dimension scores to stdout in addition to the summary.                                                                                                                                  |

Cadence note: `/insights` is token-heavy (run it weekly-ish);
`/self-assessment` is cheap (run it daily). The chained form above is the
full weekly refresh — drop the first two on daily runs.

## Slack notifier (optional)

1. Create an Incoming Webhook at <https://api.slack.com/apps> (new app → add
   Incoming Webhooks feature → add to channel).
2. Paste the URL into `.env.local` as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=...`. `.env.local` is
   gitignored.
3. Set `slack.enabled: true` in `assessment.config.json` (it's true by default).
4. `npm run assess` will now post a scored card with strengths, biggest gaps,
   and an "Open dashboard" button linking to `publish.publicUrl`
   (default: `http://localhost:3737`).

The card link only works on your own machine because the dashboard is local.
That's intentional — the score is personal.

## Daily 07:15 run (optional)

Uses macOS `launchd`. Laptop is woken from sleep if needed; missed runs fire on
next wake.

```bash
npm run schedule:install     # one-time
launchctl start com.$(whoami).claude-mastery   # fire once to test
npm run schedule:uninstall   # remove
```

The installer reads `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` from `.env.local` and bakes it into
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.<you>.claude-mastery.plist`. See
[`ROUTINE.md`](./ROUTINE.md) for the full explanation of why `/schedule`
doesn't work here (Anthropic-cloud routines can't read your local
`~/.claude/`).

The rubric and scoring engine are generic. Everything identifying — display
name, channel, webhook, and your actual scores — stays on your machine.

## Sharing this repo

Fork it or push it under your own account. A new user's experience:

```bash
git clone <your-fork>
cd <your-fork>
npm install
npm run setup
# edit assessment.config.json → their displayName
# (optional) edit .env.local → their webhook
npm run assess:print
npm run dev
```

No PRs touching `rubric.json` are needed per-user. Retunes of the target
profile (e.g. raising the permissions target) are the only reason to send a PR
back upstream.

## Tuning the rubric

`app/data/rubric.json` is the target profile. Each dimension has a `weight`
(1–3, how high-leverage the area is) and a `target` (0–100, what "good" looks
like). The overall score is a weight-normalized mean.

Change those two numbers per dimension to match your team's philosophy. A
security-first team might weight `permissions: 3` and `target: 95`; a research
lab might push `learning: 3` and drop `scheduled: 1`.

New dimensions need a matching scorer function in `scripts/score.mjs` keyed on
`id`. Without one, the dimension renders with score 0 and a "not-touched" tier.

## FAQ

**Why not use `/schedule` for the daily run?**
`/schedule` routines run in Anthropic's cloud. They don't have access to your
local `~/.claude/` directory, which is exactly what the scorer reads. `launchd`
is the local equivalent that can still wake your laptop.

**Does the dashboard need to be deployed?**
No. The default config points at `http://localhost:3737`. If you want the
Slack "Open dashboard" button to work from your phone, deploy the Next.js app
(`vercel deploy --prod`) and update `publish.publicUrl`.

**Why are scores lower than I expected?**
Scoring rewards what _you_ built (custom agents, commands, hooks), not what
plugins provide. Boris's rule is "if you do something 2×/day, make it a skill."
Score accordingly. Set `scoring.includePluginSkillsAsPersonal: true` in
`assessment.config.json` if you disagree.

**Where do Boris's tips come from?**
The `boris` skill at `~/.claude/skills/boris` (installed with the
`andrej-karpathy-skills` or `claude-code-workflows` marketplace). The rubric's
`borisTips` field cross-references section numbers.

## Surfacing Claude's `/insights` analysis in the dashboard

The dashboard scores your usage from raw signals on its own. Two opt-in paths
let you also surface Claude's own analysis — both read artifacts already on
your disk, neither auto-captures anything.

**1. One-click HTML report button.** When you run `/insights`, Claude Code
writes a full HTML report to `~/.claude/usage-data/report.html`. The
dashboard detects the file and shows an "Open Claude's full /insights
report" button that streams it locally through `/api/insights-report`. Same
posture as reading the JSON telemetry: a static file Claude Code wrote to
your machine, served locally for your own consumption.

**2. Inline markdown summary** (optional). For a condensed narrative
rendered inline, file it into `app/data/insights-narrative.md` via any of
three user-driven paths:

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/insights
# Then pick one:
/refresh-insights                   # slash command — Claude files the markdown verbatim
pbpaste | npm run import-insights   # pipe the macOS clipboard
# or paste into app/data/insights-narrative.md directly
```

The markdown file is gitignored, rendered locally, never uploaded, and
never posted to Slack. `/refresh-insights` is a thin convenience wrapper —
it only files output that `/insights` already produced in your session,
never invokes `/insights` on its own, and won't paraphrase or augment the
text. The HTML report is served only on localhost via the local Next
route. The dashboard never invokes `/insights` itself, never captures API
output, and never persists anything beyond the files you choose to create.

## Attribution & relationship to Claude Code

This is an **independent, open-source community tool**. It is **not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic**.

What the dashboard actually does:

- Reads files that Claude Code writes to your local `~/.claude/` directory
  during normal use — settings, installed plugins, project memory, and the
  per-session telemetry under `~/.claude/usage-data/`. Those are your files on
  your machine; this tool just reads them and computes its own scores.
- The Execution-axis scoring and the progression timeline rely on the same
  local data files that Claude Code's built-in `/insights` command reads.
  This project does **not** reuse `/insights` output, replicate its UI, or
  call any Anthropic API. References to `/insights` in the dashboard describe
  the data source format only.
- "Claude", "Claude Code", and "/insights" are trademarks of Anthropic, used
  here only to identify the platform this tool complements — not to imply
  endorsement or partnership.
