      <Section title="Two axes, not one composite">
        <p>
          Mastery here is scored on two independent axes rather than collapsed into a single number.
          A composite would obscure the very thing this dashboard exists to surface — the gap between
          how Claude Code is <em>configured</em> and how it&apos;s actually <em>used</em>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-[color:var(--color-good)]">Platform Setup</strong> — derived from your
            local <span className="mono">~/.claude</span> setup: settings, plugins, custom
            agents/commands/skills, hooks, project memory, and CLAUDE.md health. It answers:{" "}
            <em>are the tools in place?</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-[color:var(--color-warn)]">Execution</strong> — derived from
            behavioral signals in <span className="mono">~/.claude/usage-data</span> (the same files{" "}
            <span className="mono">/insights</span> reads). It answers: <em>are you using them?</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The diagnostic case is a high Platform Setup score paired with a low Execution score — every
          tool installed, none of them used. The <strong>Δ</strong> readout on the dashboard makes
          this gap explicit.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What each Execution scorer measures (9 of 12 dimensions)">
        <p>
          Nine dimensions currently have execution scorers. Each formula is a deterministic
          function over the signals named below — open <span className="mono">scripts/score.mjs</span>{" "}
          to read the source.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Permissions &amp; Safety</strong> — <span className="mono">autoRatio × 100 − bypassRatio × 120</span>.
            Soft 1.2× asymmetry: auto is preferred, but occasional bypass doesn&apos;t crush a
            mostly-auto workflow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parallel Execution &amp; Subagents</strong> — subagent dispatch ratio (weighted 2×)
            plus worktree usage when transcripts are opted in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Planning &amp; Delegation</strong> — plan mode adoption within multi-task sessions
            (linear; gated when no multi-task sessions exist).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integrations</strong> — <span className="mono">min(plugin_calls / sessions / 2, 1) × 100</span>.
            Volume-per-session, not coverage. Specialty plugins that only fire in their context aren&apos;t
            penalized; idle plugins surface as informational evidence instead of dragging the score.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification</strong> — <span className="mono">100 × exp(−missRate × 8)</span>.
            Smooth exponential decay over friction events (buggy_code + wrong_approach) per session.
            Never goes negative; a 15% miss rate ≈ 30, 30% ≈ 9.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automation &amp; Hooks</strong> — hook fires per session plus a bonus when personal
            agents are in use. Routes to <em>unmeasured</em> when{" "}
            <span className="mono">~/.claude/hook-fires.jsonl</span> is absent (Claude Code does not
            emit this telemetry by default).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scheduled &amp; Autonomous Workflows</strong> — presence-and-intensity over
            CronCreate / CronDelete / CronList / ScheduleWakeup invocations. 1 invocation in window = 50,
            ≥3 = 100. Volume-per-session would wash the signal out — these tools fire too rarely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remote &amp; Mobile</strong> — same presence-and-intensity curve over RemoteTrigger /
            PushNotification / SendMessage invocations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learning &amp; Explanatory Mode</strong> — <span className="mono">learningModeSessionRatio × 100</span>.
            Counts sessions where Claude emitted the <span className="mono">★ Insight</span> banner
            from the explanatory-output-style plugin. Platform Setup credits installation; this scorer
            credits actual use. Caveat: the substring match depends on the plugin&apos;s banner
            string, so a future plugin upgrade could regress this signal silently.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Why the remaining 3 dimensions are unmeasured">
        <p>
          Three dimensions render with no Execution vertex. Each has an explicit{" "}
          <span className="mono">gapReason</span> visible on the per-dimension card so users can
          tell <em>which</em> kind of unmeasured it is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Model &amp; Effort Tuning</strong>, <strong>Memory &amp; Context Management</strong>,
            <strong> Terminal &amp; Customization</strong> — <em>not feasible from /insights</em>. The
            relevant signals never reach the cooked telemetry: model/effort are not written to{" "}
            <span className="mono">session-meta</span>; memory-related tools do not appear in{" "}
            <span className="mono">tool_counts</span>; terminal/IDE customization (statusline, theme,
            keybindings) is purely client-side configuration. Platform-Setup-only is the honest position.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The radar shows what is honestly measured. <em>Unmeasured</em> is not <em>scored zero</em>,
          and the per-dimension card always tells you which is which.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Calibration philosophy">
        <p>
          Execution scoring rewards <em>directional progress</em>, not perfection. Earlier iterations
          used linear amplifiers and coverage ratios that produced near-zero scores for engineers
          who were actively improving — discouraging the very behavior the dashboard is meant to
          encourage. The current formulas follow three principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Smooth decay over linear amplification.</strong> Verification uses{" "}
            <span className="mono">exp(−missRate × 8)</span> instead of{" "}
            <span className="mono">100 − missRate × 500</span>. A productive engineer with a 15%
            friction rate now scores 30 instead of 25, and the curve never drops below 0 pre-clamp.
            Friction events are partly &quot;Claude caught a bug&quot; — not pure failures — so the
            penalty saturates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soft asymmetry over crushing penalties.</strong> Permissions weights bypass at
            1.2× auto rather than 2×. The asymmetry is preserved (auto strictly preferred) but a
            50/50 mix scores ~10 instead of −10, so incremental progress moves the needle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Volume over coverage.</strong> Integrations measures plugin calls per session,
            not the share of installed plugins that fired. Hoarding specialty plugins doesn&apos;t
            inflate the score; using your installed plugins regularly does. Idle plugins are reported
            as informational evidence, not as a denominator that punishes breadth.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal is honest scoring that defends itself for any user — not just the developer who
          tuned it. If a formula produces a degenerate score because a data source is structurally
          absent (rather than because behavior is low), the scorer routes to{" "}
          <em>unmeasured</em> via <span className="mono">gapReason</span> instead of returning a
          numeric zero.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Lookback windows">
        <p>
          Two configurable windows control how far back signals are read, in{" "}
          <span className="mono">assessment.config.json</span>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className="mono">scoring.insightsLookbackDays</span> — default <strong>30</strong>.
            Aggregation window for Execution scoring. A short window favours recent habits; a long
            one rewards consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="mono">scoring.progressionLookbackDays</span> — default{" "}
            <strong>null</strong> (full history). The progression timeline walks all sessions to
            detect &quot;first&quot; events that may have happened months ago. The{" "}
            &quot;stopped using bypass&quot; detector additionally requires recent overall activity
            so it doesn&apos;t fire for users who simply stopped using Claude.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="mono">scoring.includeTranscripts</span> — default <strong>false</strong>.
            Opt-in scan of raw <span className="mono">~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl</span> transcripts
            to detect permission-mode adoption, worktree usage, and skill attribution. Skipped by
            default because the scan is expensive (hundreds of MB on active users).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Gap reasons, not silent zeros">
        <p>
          When an Execution score is missing, the <span className="mono">gapReason</span> field
          tells you <em>why</em> rather than rendering as 0. Common reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>No /insights data yet</em> — <span className="mono">~/.claude/usage-data</span> is absent (fresh install)</li>
          <li><em>Insufficient session count</em> — fewer sessions in the lookback window than the dimension requires</li>
          <li><em>Transcript opt-in required</em> — the dimension needs raw transcripts and the flag is off</li>
          <li><em>Hook-fire telemetry absent</em> — <span className="mono">~/.claude/hook-fires.jsonl</span> is not emitted by Claude Code by default; Automation execution is unmeasured rather than scored 0</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Weights and overall scoring">

        <p>
          The dashboard&apos;s scoring is independent of <span className="mono">/insights</span>: it reads

          Platform Setup and Execution scores. If you also want Claude&apos;s own analysis surfaced here, there
          are two paths — both rely on artifacts already on your disk, neither auto-captures anything.

          1. The full HTML report (one-click button)
        </h3>
        <p>

          to <span className="mono">~/.claude/usage-data/report.html</span>. The dashboard detects that file
          and shows an &quot;Open Claude&apos;s full /insights report&quot; button that streams it through{" "}

          the JSON telemetry: a static file Claude Code wrote to your machine, served locally for your eyes
          only. We don&apos;t edit, augment, or redistribute it.
